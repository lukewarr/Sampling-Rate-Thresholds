# Sampling-Rate-Thresholds For Accelerometer

This project took place at NASA's Space Grant Consortium when developing and testing lunar satellites. The goal was to test sampling rates for our highest sampling sensor, the accelerometer. This goal had two objectives with the experiment, one being to still receive good and usable data in hard circumstances with extremely low frequency moonquakes and micrometeor impacts. The other goal was to limit the sample rate for both EEPROM storage and eventually LoRa Transmission. I faced a large challenge as these two goals combat eachother and make it quite difficult to match both specifications. The middleground was still not hitting both goals and I thought it might not be possible with our sensor and storage capabilities. However we found a solution to clean and smooth the data beforehand. This allows for the threshold to be moved down as the noise is drastically reduced curing valuable data at a lesser sampling rate. I applied a smoothing factor to the incoming data during experiments and receieved good data up to 50 ft away sampling at around 20 samples per second.
